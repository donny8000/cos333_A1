Assignment Number 1

Donovan Pearce's Contribution:
We decided to primarily use my computer fot the assignment, so
I was involved in typing up the whole project. I worked to 
first get a sense of the database and help with the planning 
of how to approach the project. I, along with Annette, 
worked on each aspect of the project, from parsing the 
arguments, to calling the database through sqlite, to 
outputting the results. I also helped to develop testing, 
creating a program which could run our code and compare it 
to the reference program. I also assisted in debugging, 
looking at where our code differed from the desired output 
and working to make it consistent.
