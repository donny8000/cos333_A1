Assignment Number 1

Donovan Pearce's Contribution:
We decided to primarily use my computer fot the assignment, so
I was involved in typing up the whole project. I worked to 
first get a sense of the database and help with the planning 
of how to approach the project. I, along with Annette, 
worked on each aspect of the project, from parsing the 
arguments, to calling the database through sqlite, to 
outputting the results. I also helped to develop testing, 
creating a program which could run our code and compare it 
to the reference program. I also assisted in debugging, 
looking at where our code differed from the desired output 
and working to make it consistent.

Annette Lee's Contribution:
I helped out with a lot of the conceptual work on the
assignment, from working through parsing the arguments to how
we eventually printed things like results. I also helped a lot
with debugging--if there was some weird error/anomaly that 
couldn't be attributed to a simple typo, I would quickly 
scramble to find out a solution, or in some cases, an 
alternative way to achieve the result we desired. I was also
very good at finding simpler errors, like typos. For almost
all of the code that was created, I was by Donovan's side
helping out with the coding process.

Help from Other People: None
